Compile:
1. Create a new folder named alphabet in the root directory of the dictionary and extract all files in the rar file into ./alphabet.
2. Run ./configure (The uploaded configure file works for x64 Linux. One needs to modify the configure file for other architecture)
3. Run ./dic and you're good to go.
